# Polaris Equity Research Report  
Semiconductor Industry & Financial Markets: A Quantitative Valuation Framework

This repository contains the full equity research report and supporting Python-based models developed by Arya Somu of Polaris Research Group. The report analyzes the financial performance, valuation, and strategic positioning of three semiconductor leaders—NVIDIA (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and ASML (ASML)—through a structured, data-driven methodology.

## Overview

This research introduces a quantitative approach to equity valuation, blending traditional financial modeling with Python-based automation. The methodology includes income statement forecasting, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and scenario-based sensitivity testing. 

The report is formatted in LaTeX to meet the standards expected by institutional analysts and academic reviewers.

## Methodology Summary

- **Financial Forecasting**  
  Multi-year projections for revenue, gross margin, R&D, EBIT, and EPS.

- **Valuation Framework**  
  Custom-built DCF models for each company using forecasted free cash flows and weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

- **Sensitivity Analysis**  
  Matrix tables evaluating the effects of changes in terminal growth and discount rates on target valuations.

- **Comparative Metrics**  
  Peer benchmarking across valuation multiples: P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Price/Sales.

- **Industry & Company Commentary**  
  Analysis of macroeconomic drivers, AI investment trends, supply chain risk, and capital allocation strategy.


## Sample Output

**NVIDIA DCF Valuation Summary**  
- Market Price: $826.09  
- Implied Value (Base Case): $942.57  
- Assumptions: 9.0% WACC, 4.5% terminal growth  
- Projected Upside: +14.2%

**ASML Sensitivity Table**  

| WACC \ Growth | 3.5% | 4.0% | 4.5% |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| 8.5%          | 682  | 710  | 742  |
| 9.0%          | 659  | 686  | 715  |
| 9.5%          | 637  | 661  | 689  |
